## What did I learn? 
- [x] Basic analysis (Asymptotic analysis worst case and average, differences between behaviours of algorithms in the best, worst and average case, The Master theorem, Ordo, Omega, Theta - notation, common complexity classes, Empirical estimate of complexity, time and memory complexity, recursion analysis of algorithms)
- [x] Strategies for algorithms and data abstraction (Brute-force algorithms, Greedy algorithms, Decomposition algorithms, Backtracking, Heuristics)
- [x] Basic algorithms (Simple numerical algorithms, Sequential and binary search algorithms, Quadratic sorting algorithms (selection, insertion), Sorting in O(N log N) (Quicksort, Heapsort, Mergesort), Hash tables including such that avoid collision, Binary search trees, Representations of graph (neighbour lists, neighbour matrices), Depth first search and Width first search, Shortest path algorithms (the algorithms of Dijkstra and Floyd), Transitive closure (Floyd's algorithm), Minimum spanning trees (the algorithms of Prim and Kruskal), Topological sorting.
- [x] Basic computability (Solvable and unsolvable problems, computable and non-computable functions, The halting problem, Consequences of undecidability)
- [x] P VS NP (Definitions of the classes P and NP, NP-completeness (Cook's theorem), common NP-complete problems)
